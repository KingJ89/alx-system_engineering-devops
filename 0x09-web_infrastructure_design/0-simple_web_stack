User Accessing the Website:

    Hey there! So, imagine you're sitting at your computer and you want to visit our website, www.foobar.com. You know how you type web addresses into your browser? Well, that's what you'd do here.

Server:

    Think of the server as a big, powerful computer. It's like the brain of our website. It holds all the important stuff, like pictures, text, and data, so when you want to see our website, the server sends it to you.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

    Okay, so a domain name is like the address of a website. It's the thing you type into your browser to find us. When you type www.foobar.com, it's like saying, "Hey server, I want to see what's on www.foobar.com, please!"

DNS Record for www:

    Now, the "www" part is just a way to say "world wide web." It's like adding "www" in front of the domain name is just a special way to help the internet find our website. It's kind of like putting a label on a box so you know what's inside.

Web Server (Nginx):

    So, the web server is like the waiter at a restaurant. When you ask for something (like a web page), the web server goes to the kitchen (the server) and brings it back to you. It's the one that makes sure you get what you asked for.

Application Server:

    Now, the application server is like the chef in the kitchen. It's the one that actually makes the food (or in our case, the web pages). It takes your requests and puts together all the pieces to create the web pages you see.

Database (MySQL):

    Lastly, the database is like a giant filing cabinet. It's where we keep all the information, like user accounts and posts. Whenever the application server needs to find something, it checks the database to see if it's there.

Communication with User's Computer:

    When you want to see our website, your computer sends a message over the internet to our server. It's like sending a letter in the mail. The server gets your message, finds the right stuff, and sends it back to your computer, where your browser puts it all together so you can see the website.
