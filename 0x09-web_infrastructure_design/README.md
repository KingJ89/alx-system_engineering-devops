User Accessing the Website:

    So, imagine you're a user who wants to visit our website, www.foobar.com. You type the URL into your web browser and hit enter.

Server:

    We've got this one server right here. It's the heart of our web infrastructure, handling everything.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

    Think of the domain name as our website's address. It's like having a house with a street address. www.foobar.com is how people find our website on the internet.

DNS Record for www:

    Now, the "www" part of www.foobar.com? That's a special type of DNS record called a CNAME. It's like saying "www" is an alias for the main domain.

Web Server (Nginx):

    This is our web server, Nginx. It's like the gatekeeper of our website. When someone wants to access a page, Nginx handles their request and serves up the content.

Application Server:

    Here's our application server. It's where all the magic happens! Our website's code lives here. When you request a dynamic page, like a personalized profile, the application server generates it for you.

Database (MySQL):

    Meet our database, MySQL. It's like the library of our website, storing all the data. When you log in or submit a form, MySQL handles the information behind the scenes.

Communication with User's Computer:

    When you want to access our website, your computer sends a request over the internet. It travels through routers and switches until it reaches our server's IP address. Then, our server processes the request, sends back the content, and voila! You see our website on your screen.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

    Now, here's the tricky part. Since everything is on this one server, if anything goes wrong with it, the whole website goes down. It's like putting all your eggs in one basket.

Downtime during Maintenance:

    Whenever we need to do maintenance, like updating the website or restarting the server, the website goes offline temporarily. It's like closing down a store for renovations.

Limited Scalability:

    Lastly, if our website gets super popular and we have tons of visitors, our infrastructure might struggle to keep up. We'd need to upgrade our server or rethink our setup to handle the traffic influx. It's like trying to fit too many people in a small room.
